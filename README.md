# Athena Chrome Extension

Athena is a Chrome extension that breaks down language barriers on Medium.com, making content accessible to readers worldwide and helping writers reach a global audience.

## Why Athena?

Medium.com hosts millions of articles, but according to Medium's official documentation, the majority of content is written in English. This creates two significant challenges:

1. **Reader Accessibility**: Many potential readers who aren't fluent in English are excluded from accessing valuable content, insights, and knowledge shared on Medium.

2. **Writer Limitations**: Writers who are more comfortable writing in their native language face barriers in reaching Medium's predominantly English-speaking audience, limiting their ability to:
   - Share their expertise with a global readership
   - Build an international following
   - Participate in Medium's Partner Program for earning potential

Athena solves these challenges by providing:
- Real-time translation of English articles for readers
- Translation support for writers creating content in their native language
- On-device translation using Chrome's AI Translation API for privacy and performance

## Features

- Translates English articles on Medium.com to the user's selected language
- Provides a user-friendly chat interface in the side panel
- Translates all UI elements to the user's preferred language
- Offers a writing mode to translate content from any language to English
- Uses Chrome's on-device AI Translation for secure and fast translations
